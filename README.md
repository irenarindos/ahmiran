=======
Ahmiran is a 2D game prototype developed over two weeks in C++ and was the final project for a 2D Game Engine Design course. 
It was a group project with my teammate,  Matthew Stratton. 

There are 3 classes the player can choose from: a warrior, a wizard and an archer. There is one map with groups of 
different enemies scattered throughout. The player can kill enemies and level up. The game uses SDL library for graphics and 
sound, and Expat XML as the base for xml parsing. 

Features of the game include parsing of many attributes from an xml file (player and monster stats, sprite sheet source 
locations, screen and world dimensions, etc.),  projectiles, explosions, collision detection, and basic AI (patrolling,
chasing and attacking).
